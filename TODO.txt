NOTE:

1. Might be a good idea to allow field component to be returned as a `li` for list markup.
2. Error handle duplicate field names.

TODO: 
1. The `Label` for attribute should be the same as the input id. 
2. The `Label` should be clickable and set focus to the associated input 
3. CSS class name assignment fit according to style guied MSN.

TODO Maybe:
1. FieldSet
2. Legend

TODO: Long
1. Fix proptype ref setup.
2. Add compound component `Option` for Select component.
3. Role attributes

ISSUES:
1. Radio error shows up weird, markup in general needs more thought.
2. Surrounding the Field with a p tag gives invalid markup warning.
3. Adding the error class was inconvientient since they should all look the same.
4. 

FIX:
1. Looks like radio doesn't have an error class.
