NOTE:
1. Might be a good idea to allow field component to be returned as a `li` for list markup.
2. Error handle duplicate field names.

2. The `Label` should be clickable and set focus to the associated input 
3. CSS class name assignment fit according to style guied MSN.

TODO Maybe:
1. FieldSet
2. Legend

ISSUES:
1. Radio error shows up weird, markup in general needs more thought.

FIX:
1. Looks like radio doesn't have an error class.
