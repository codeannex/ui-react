NOTE:

1. Might be a good idea to allow field component to be returned as a `li` for list markup.
2. Error handle duplicate field names.

TODO: 
1. The `Label` for attribute should be the same as the input id. 
2. The `Label` should be clickable and set focus to the associated input 
3. CSS class name assignment fit according to style guied MSN.

TODO Maybe:
1. FieldSet
2. Legend

TODO: Long
1. Fix proptype ref setup.
2. Add compound component `Option` for Select component.

ISSUES:
1. Radio error shows up weird, markup in general needs more thought.
2. Surrounding the Field with a p tag gives invalid markup warning.
3. Adding the error class was inconvientient since they should all look the same.
4. 

FIX:
1. Looks like radio doesn't have an error class.

CURRENT GIT:
BRANCH: dev/refactor_form_component
1. refactored the way ref is set by removing use of react clone element.
2. added prop docs to the components.
3. removed uuid use in radio and select components and added required id key/value for the options.
4. deleted setupInputRefs utils function.
5. 

IN PROGRESS:
